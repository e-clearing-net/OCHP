# OCHP - Open Clearing House Protocol

The purpose of the Open Clearing House Protocol is to connect market actors in the
field of electric mobility charging infrastructure.

## Development OCHP 1.5

The development process of OCHP 1.5 will consist of three major phases that are heavily influenced by agile software development practices.
### Stage 1: User Stories
In the first step, user stories are written from the perspective of the market. They cover the motivational aspects of the protocol development, answering the question of 'Why' something should happen. An initial set of user stories will be provided, further stories will be added from various online workshops and other user interactions.

### Stage 2: Use Cases & Modules
Once the User Stories have been discussed with the community, Use Cases will be defined that describe how the User Stories are to be implemented using OCHP. They define the intended flow of messages as well as the situations they are to be expected. The central question to be answered is 'What' exactly should be happening.
The use cases will be grouped into various modules following a common theme. The purpose of modules is to allow partial protocol implementations to follow an organised scheme, in order to make sure the capabilities of a given implementation are readily apparent. 

### Stage 3: Specification
Once the message flows have been defined and the intention and the general idea of what's supposed to happen in the protocol, the exact details will be worked out by an open, public working group that everyone is invited to join into.
