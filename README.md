# Development OCHP 1.5

This branch serves to develop the 1.5 version of the OCHP protocol.  
The procedure will start with defining the user stories that describe the motivations and goals of various actors in the e-mobility market.  
Once the User Stories have been discussed with the community, Use Cases will be defined that describe how the User Stories are to be implemented using OCHP.  
The Use Cases will be grouped into Modules allowing different degrees of functionalities.

## Changes
- OCHP 1.5 will only be available as a JSON/REST based definition
- OCHP 1.5 will be published under the same MIT license as previous versions, meeting the definition of open source software by the Open Source Initiative
- There will be no distinction between OCHP and OCHP Direct. OCHP Direct Functionality will become a Module in OCHP 1.5
