# Introduction




## Primary Stakeholders Electric Vehicles

The purpose of the Open Clearing House Protocol is to connect market
actors in the field of electric mobility charging infrastructure. The
different relevant market roles are as shown in the market overview
figure:
 * The *EV user* of the overall system - a human charging an electric
   car via the connected infrastructure, having a direct or indirect
   service contract with an EVSP.
 * The *EVSP* (Electric Vehicle Service Provider) - granting access to
   charging stations and thus offering services to the contracted EV
   user. The service offer is supported by the market roles EVSE
   Operator and NSP.
 * The *EVSE Operator* (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Operator) -
   operating charging stations.
 * The *NSP* (Navigation Service Provider) - offering relevant
   navigation services to the EV user.
 * The *PSO* (Parking Spot Operator) - owning and/or operating the parking
   spots that allow access to the charging infrastructure owned/operated
   by the EVSE Operator.
 * The *Clearing House Operator* - running a software platform called
   Clearing House to enable data exchange between the market roles (2)
   to (4).

In the context of a clearing house system the market roles (2) to (4)
are referred as *partners*, the role (5) is called
*administrator*. The role (1) is not explicitly known to the system.
The role of a clearing house in terms of this document is to facilitate
the exchange of roaming authorisations, charge point information and
charge detail records between the market participants. Other clearing
houses and local networks might serve the same purpose on a different
scale/region or with different partners. The connection to other
clearing houses is out of scope in the current state. The market roles
are defined in the following section. One company however might fulfil
one or more market roles. The contracts between each actor and the data
routing are part of the clearing house's business logic and out of scope
for this protocol description.

![Figure EV charging infrastructure market overview](media/EV-charging-market-overview.png "EV charging infrastructure market overview")


### Electric Vehicle User (EV User)

The EV user has a direct or indirect service contract with an EVSP who
grants access to a specified charging infrastructure of one or more EVSE
Operators. The EV users identify their selves via an access token issued
by the EVSP.


### Electric Vehicle Service Provider (EVSP)

The EVSP operates as a contract party for the EV user. The EV Service
Provider takes care of the EV user authentication and billing processes.
The EV Service Provider provides the EV-customer authorization tokens
(i.e. RFID-card, Certificates, ... ) that give authorisation to use
the charging stations of contracted EVSE Operators.


### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Operator (EVSE Operator)

The EVSE operator operates as contract party for the EVSP. The charging
stations (EVSE) of the EVSE operator are accessible by a specified set
of EV users of the contracted EVSPs. The EVSP pays the EVSE operator for
the charging services received by its contracted EV users.


### Navigation Service Provider (NSP)

The NSP offers service towards the EV user for searching, locating and
routing to EVSEs of the contracted EVSE operators. It therefore may have
contracts with EVSE operators or EVSPs.


### Parking Spot Operator (PSO)

The PSO offers multiple services to the Operator as well as the EV Driver and
NSP. They offer access to a parking spot associated with an EVSE to the
EV driver and sometimes the location for the EVSE to the EVSE-Op. Furthermore,
they may operate services that allow detailed tracking of the occupation
of single parking spots, thus enhancing Operator-data sent to an NSP.


### Charging Session

A charging session in the scope of this document is defined from the
successful authorization of the user at the charge point. It is
considered active until the successful authorized stop command was
executed (first figure below) or the car was disconnected from the
charge point manually (second figure below). This is considered a
forced unauthorized ending.

![Figure Example for an authorized end of a charging session](media/ChargingSessionDefinition-1.png "Example for an authorized end of a charging session")

![Figure Example for a forced end of a charging session](media/ChargingSessionDefinition-2.png "Example for a forced end of a charging session")



## Clearing House

The basic idea of a Clearing House is to enable the connected partners
to roam with each other. The goal of roaming is that EV users can
easily charge their electric vehicle on every charging station of
different EVSE operators. With roaming support, provided by the Clearing
House, the complexity of relationships can be reduced: from many-to-many
bilateral partner connection towards a one-to-many connection between
the Clearing House and the partners. The figure illustrates the overall
system overview of all partners with their systems and the clearing
house system with the EV user as service consumer.

![Figure Global System Overview](media/global-system-overview.png "Global System Overview")

A different view to the implementation of the described role model gives
figure below. The clearing house provides here a central
connection between the operator layer — where the charging stations are
located — and the provider layer — where the users are. Direct
connections of two roaming partners on the same layer are not necessary.
Each partner operates a single connection to the clearing house from
through which they get connected to multiple partners on the other
layers.
Some of the partners might take two or more roles on different layers.
For each of their roles a connection to the clearing house is necessary
to connect to other roaming partners. The internal data connection
between the distinct roles of one single partner might or might not be
routed through the clearing house.
For the sake of simplification only two layers are shown in this figure.
The same principles apply to the navigation service layer. Also other
additional clearing houses could exist in this model.

![Figure Layer model of clearing house connections](media/ClearingHouseLayerModel.png "Layer model of clearing house connections")




## Clearing House functionality

An EV clearing house in the scope of this protocol facilitates the
mutual exchange of roaming authorisations, charge data & charge point
information between its partners. The formal act of clearing - as meant
here - is the assignment of charge detail records to the corresponding
EV Service Provider. The financial clearing has to be executed in a
subsequent process step and is out of scope of the interface addressed
by OCHP. However, the here defined data types are meant to be used as a
base to calculate the payment request.
Normally the following steps are followed, (*highlighted* steps are
in scope of OCHP):

 * *An EVSP (Partner A) uploads authorisation data of its EV users to
   the Clearing House (CH).*
 * *The EVSE operators that have a roaming contract with (A), download
   this authorisation data from the CH.*
 * The EVSE operators enable these authorisations to be used on their
   charge points.
 * The EV users of partner (A) can now charge their electric vehicles
   at all charge points of the EVSE operators named in step 2.
 * *The EVSE operator uploads the charge data (using Charge Detail
   Records) to the CH.*
 * *This charge data is then routed by the CH towards partner (A) using
   OCHP.*
 * Partner (A) pays the roaming partner for the charging action done by
   its customer.
 * Partner (A) bills its customer.



## Functional principles of an EV Clearing House

As an intermediate between two independent roaming partners, a clearing
house serves to simplify and unify the data connection. There are few
main principles, the business logic of a clearing house for electric
mobility should follow. Those basic rules are:

 * *Transparency* The existence of a clearing house should be
   completely transparent for the EV user. The roaming connection
   between an operator and a provider may or may not be routed through
   a clearing house.
 * *Independence* Roaming connections between two roaming partners and
   their business models or tariffs should not be influenced by the
   logic of the clearing house.
 * *Anonymity*    The clearing house should require as little private
   user data as possible.

OCHP supports those basic principles and aims to be capable to any
business model following them.



## OCHPdirect Extension

Starting with Protocol Version 1.3, OCHP offers the possibility to
open a _direct_ communication between two roaming partners. The
following figure illustrates the additional data path.

![Figure OCHP direct Basic Overview](media/OCHPdirectBasicOverview.png "OCHP direct Basic Overview")

The direct communication between operators and providers allows the
implementation of fundamental new use cases between two roaming
partners. Those use cases are:

 * **Remote Start:** A user starts a charging process at an operator‘s
   charge pole by using a provider‘s app. They are starting the process
   from a – of the operator's point of view – remote service.
 * **Remote Stop:** A user stops a charging process at an operator‘s
   charge pole by using a provider‘s app (that was remotely started).
 * **Live Info:** A user requests information about a charging process
   at an operator’s charge pole by using a provider’s app (from which
   the process was started).
 * **Charge Event:** A user gets informed by a provider’s app about
   status changes of a charging process at an operator’s charge pole,
   even if it wasn't started remotely.
 * **Remote Control:** A user controls a charging process at an
   operator‘s charge pole that was not remotely started by using a
   provider‘s app.
 * **Remote Action:** A user triggers advanced and not charging process
   related actions at a charge point or charging station of an operator.


### Definition of OCHP direct

Being an extension to the pure OCHP, the messages and data types used
for OCHPdirect are defined in a [seperate document](OCHP-direct.md).
Within the current document, only the extension to OCHP is described.
The complete description of the functionality and implementation of
_OCHPdirect_ can be found in its seperate documentation.






# CH-Partner Interface description

The interfaces between the system of the Clearing House and systems of
the different partners consist of the six following components:

 * Exchange of Authorisation Data (Roaming Authorisations,
   RoamingAuthorisationInfo)
 * Exchange of Charge Data, the raw billing data (Charge Detail
   Records, CDRInfo)
 * Exchange of Charge Point Information (Static and live POI data,
   ChargePointInfo)
 * Exchange of Tariff Information (TariffInfo)
 * Single Authorization Requests (Single-Token-Requests)
 * Exchange of Parking Spot Information (Static and live data)

From the data flow perspective, each market role is a source or a sink
for certain data types. The figure below gives an overview of
the exchanged data types, their direction and their particular
originating and consuming market role.

![Figure Data flow and direction overview](media/DataFlows.png "Data flow and direction overview")

The exchange of data takes place via standardized web services.



## Exchange Authorisation Data



### Upload own authorisation data (roaming list) to the CHS

The MDM of each EVSP has to exchange the own authorisation data with the
Clearing House to share that data with EVSE Operators. The upload of the
own roaming list is done in the following way:

 * MDM sends the SetRoamingAuthorisationList.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a SetRoamingAuthorisationList.conf PDU.



### Update own authorisation data (roaming list) in the CHS

For later updates of authorization data from the MDM to the Clearing
House and the EVSE Operators, only the changed entries (delta) have to
be transferred. The updated roaming list entries have to be sent the
following way:

 * MDM sends the UpdateRoamingAuthorisationList.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a UpdateRoamingAuthorisationList.conf PDU.



### Download global roaming authorisation data from CHS

A CMS downloads the global authorisation data repository from the CHS.
The download of the global roaming list is done in the following way:

 * CMS sends the GetRoamingAuthorisationList.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with GetRoamingAuthorisationList.conf PDU.



### Download updates in global roaming authorisation data from CHS

A CMS downloads the changes to the global authorisation data repository
since the last synchronization from the CHS. The updates in the global
roaming list can be done in the following way:

 * CMS sends the GetRoamingAuthorisationListUpdates.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with GetRoamingAuthorisationListUpdates.conf PDU.




## Exchange Charge Data

The exchange of charge data is be done by sending records containing
all billing information from the EVSE-Operator to the corresponding
EVSP. The data set is called Charge Detail Record (CDR). Each CDR
contains a status value that reflects the processing state of the
record within the clearing house roaming connection. The figure in the
next section illustrates the status flow for each CDR.

##### CDR Validation Process
In bilateral agreed intervals, the EVSE-Operator or CDR-"Originator"
sends all relevant CDRs to the Clearing House. A basic plausibility
check is performed by the Clearing House and determines if the CDRs can
be accepted. Implausible CDRs will directly be sent back to the
CDR-"Originator" and can be adjusted. A corrected version of the CDR
can again be uploaded to the Clearing House with the next call. Already
uploaded CDRs will have the status *new* set by the Clearing House.
Plausible CDRs will be marked as *accepted* and forwarded to the EV
Service Provider or CDR-"Owner" for approval.
The CDR-"Owner" downloads (in bilaterally agreed intervals) the list of
CDRs from all providers. After an internal validation check in the
backend, the EVSP uploads a list of approved and declined CDRs to the
Clearing House. Approved CDRs will be marked as such and their status
is set to *approved*. These CDRs will then be archived and will not
be included in the standard GetCDRs. Declined CDRs will be marked as
*declined* and will then be available for download by the EVSE Operator.
They now have the option to either re-upload a reworked CDR as *revised*
using the same CDR-ID or finally confirm the affected CDRs as *rejected*,
foregoing any further claims on that charging process.

![Figure Status flow for CDRs](media/CDRvalidation.png "Status flow for CDRs")



### Upload Charge Data Records

Local roaming charge data records are sent from the CMS to the CHS. The
upload has to be done in the following way:

 * CMS sends the AddCDRs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with an AddCDRs.conf PDU.



### Process Charge Data Records

Incoming roaming charge data records, held at the CHS are sent from the
CHS to the MDM. Note that only CDRs that concern the particular EVSP are
sent. The download has to be done in the following way:

 * MDM sends GetCDRs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a GetCDRs.conf PDU.
 * MDM confirms or declines individual CDRs by sending ConfirmCDRs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a ConfirmCDRs.conf PDU.

Furthermore, the CMS may download declined CDRs and attempt to fix any
issues there were by re-uploading the CDRs as "revised" or to finally
reject them (forego payment) by setting their status to "rejected".

 * CMS may send the CheckCDRs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with CheckCDRs.conf PDU according to the status provided in the request.
 * CMS may revise CDRs by sending AddCDRs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with an AddCDRs.conf PDU.
 * CMS may reject individual CDRs by sending AddCDRs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a AddCDRs.conf PDU.


##### Implementation
All CDRs stay in the download queue (GetCDRs without explicitly stating the status)
until their successful download was confirmed by a call to ConfirmCDRs.req.
Declined CDRs may be handled in a separate process as described above.

**Note:** all CDR-IDs uploaded by OCHP 1.4 will now contain the CPO-ID
for the first five characters and will thus be treated as unique across
the entire eCHS. CDRs uploaded via OCHP 1.3 are only EVSE-unique, however,
and do not necessarily contain the CPO-ID as the first five characters.




## Exchange Charge Point Information

For user information and routing purpose detailed information about charge
points can be exchanged via OCHP. The EVSE Operator sends this data
towards the systems of Navigation Service Providers. Those systems may
aggregate, sort and filter the data and provide it to the navigation
services or devices through proprietary interfaces within the NSP
ecosystem. Detailed information about the filtering of charge point
information can be found in the annex.


### Upload own charge point information to the CHS

Each CMS has to upload its own Charge point information to the Clearing
House. The upload of the own charge point information is done in the
following way:

 * CMS sends the SetChargePointList.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a SetChargePointList.conf PDU.


### Download global charge point information from the CHS

An NSP downloads the global charge point information from the CHS. The
download of the global charge point information is done in the following
way:

 * NSP sends the GetChargePointList.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with GetChargePointList.conf PDU.




## Exchange Tariff Information

The eCHS enables CPOs to upload tariffs and tariff-groups for each charge
point they operate. These tariffs may be defined for individual EMPs. This
is to ensure a quick and automated change in tariffs for certain charge points
without having to alter bilateral agreements every time and without having
a very large annex.


### Upload and Update Tariff Information to the CHS

Each CMS has to upload their tariff information to the Clearing House.
The upload and update of tariff information is done in the following way:

 * CMS sends UpdateTariffs.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with UpdateTariffs.conf PDU.


### Download Tariff Information from the CHS

An MDM has to regularly download tariff information for their roaming
partners' charge points from the Clearing House. This is done in the
following way:

 * MDM sends GetTariffUpdates.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with GetTariffUpdates.conf PDU.




## Request for a single authorization

Single authorization requests are sent from the EVSE-Operator backend
to the clearing house in the event that the local repository of
authorization records was not synchronized from the clearing house.
The figure illustrates the steps during a charging session that is
authorised by the clearing house. During the authorisation for the
start of the process the operator backend is requesting the clearing
house via OCHP. The response contains the single requested authorization
record. For the end of the charging process the operator backend is able
to authorise the same token.
Note: OCHP only allows the internal repository of authorization records
in the CHS to be checked against, which is the same list of tokens that
also gets returned when downloading roaming authorization data into the
CMS. This is not a live request at the provider backend.

![Figure Message exchange for live authorisation requests for a single charging process.](media/SingleAuthorisation.png "Message exchange for live authorisation requests for a single charging process.")


### Request the CHS to authorize one single token for roaming

A CMS may request the Clearing House to authorize one single token for a
charging session. The request for authorization is done in the following
way:

 * CMS sends the RequestLiveRoamingAuthorisation.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a RequestLiveRoamingAuthorisation.conf PDU.




## Live Status Interface

As additional status information to the static POI data of the Charge
Point Information, the Live Status Interface builds upon that. Thus,
live status data does only contain the status information of each EVSE
without further payload data. A additional time to live can be
specified until the status information may be considered as valid.
Overdue status information will be dropped by the CHS. The Navigation
System Providers are asked to request the current status for stations
without valid status information.
The current major and minor status of each EVSE shall be set following
the decision flow in figure below.

![Figure Status decision flow for EVSEs.](media/LiveStatusDecision.png "Status decision flow for EVSEs.")

Table shows the relationship of the major and minor status values.
Other combinations of the status values must not be set.

Major Status  | Minor Status | Description
:-------------|:-------------|:-------------
Unknown       | n/a          | Operator can not reliably determine the current status. TTL is set to the time the next status update is expected, normally in near future.
Available     | Available    | A new charging process can be started immediately. TTL is set to the near future, normally five minutes ahead.
Available     | Reserved     | A new charging process can be started immediately but there is a reservation in the future. TTL is set to a date until when new charging processes may be started. Usually the status will then change to *Not Available--Reserved*.
Not Available | Charging     | Charging process ongoing, charge point occupied. No new charging process can be started. TTL is set to the expected end of the charging process. For example 20 minutes ahead for quick charging.
Not Available | Blocked      | Parking spot occupied w/o ongoing charging process. This may be caused by a parked car that is not ambiguous to charge. TTL is set to a date in the near future.
Not Available | Reserved     | Reserved for now or the near future, no new charging process may be started. TTL is set to the date the reservation will expire. Usually the status will change than to either *Not Available--Charging* or to *Available--Available* if the reservation was not used..
Not Available | Out Of Order | Failure or other inoperability. TTL is set to the expected end of the failure if known. In case of longer service interruptions, the charge point status value should also be set to *Inoperative*, see  [ChargePointStatusType](#ChargePointStatusType).

Furthermore, a PSO can send live status information for their parking
spots towards the system. These will be evaluated according to the
parkingId sent with individual EVSE static POI data. The parking spot itself can have
the same major live status as an EVSE: available, not available or unknown.

In order to enable implementations to only resolve one set of status,
the status of EVSE and parking spot can be returned individually as well
as combined.


##### Implementation
Each status update from the sending operator must contain the major status
and may contain a minor status for further details. The sending operator shall only
send a status update for an EVSE in case of either change of EVSE-status or impending
epiry of the ttl-value.
Consuming Navigation System Providers must be able to process the three major status values.
Optionally they may display the minor status and the ttl-value to the user.
Furthermore, they can request the CHS to return parking spot live information
either on its own or combined with the EVSEs live status.
The clearing house or every consuming system may drop status values with an
expired ttl-value. The status of an EVSE must default to *unknown* in that case.
Consuming systems should regularly check for updates status in the CHS. In
order to guarantee a high quality and up-to-dateness of data, updated status
should be collected in short intervals.



### Update the live status of stations in the CHS

A CMS may update the current live status of individual charging stations in the Clearing House to allow roaming partners to receive those statuses. The live status update is done in the following way:

 * CMS sends the UpdateStatus.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a UpdateStatus.conf PDU.

Additionally, a PSM may update the current live status of individual parking spots, allowing the EVSE Operators roaming partners to receive these alongside the EVSE live status. The live status update is done in the same way (initiated by the PSM).


### Download global live status information from the CHS

A NSP may receive the current live status of individual charging
stations and parking spot from the Clearing House. The live status
download is done in the following way:

 * MDM sends the GetStatus.req PDU.
 * CHS responds with a GetStatus.conf PDU.

PartnerID: [Country Code] [Party-ID]

**WHERE:**  

Country Code = 2 ALPHA. Two character country code according to ISO-3166-1.  
Party-ID = 3 (ALPHA/DIGIT). Three alphanumeric characters defined and listed by the respective issuing authority.

###### Regular Expression

```regex
[A-Z]{2}[A-Za-z0-9]{3}

## Types for the Exchange of Authorisation Data

These data types are used for the purpose of the exchange of
authorisation data from an EVSP to an EVSE Operator.


### ContractId (or EVCO-ID)

The data type ContractId must follow the specification for eMA ID (eMobility Account Identifier) in
*ISO/IEC 15118-2 - Annex H "Specification of Identifiers"*. The *ISO/IEC 15118-2 - Annex H "Specification of Identifiers"* is further elaborated and interpreted by eMI³
in *"eMI3 standard version V1.0 - Part 2: Business Objects"*.   
The check digit is optional but highly recommended. For calculation see the annex.
The eMA ID must match the following structure (the notation corresponds
to the augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as defined in RFC 5234):

```ABNF
<ContractId> = <Country Code> <S> <Provider ID> <S> <ID Type> <eMA Instance> <S> <Check Digit>
<Country Code> = 2 ALPHA
    ; two character country code according to ISO 3166-1 (Alpha-2-Code)
<Provider ID> = 3 (ALPHA / DIGIT)
    ; three alphanumeric characters, referring to the EMSP. The ID is issued by the relevant authority of the specific country.  
    For example, bdew in Germany, eViolin in Netherlands.
<ID Type> = “C”
    ; one character “C” indicating that this ID represents a reference to a “Contract”
<eMA Instance> = 8 (ALPHA / DIGIT)
    ; eight alphanumeric characters referring to the internal service contract between EMSP and its customer
<Check Digit> = *1 (ALPHA / DIGIT)
    ; Optional but highly recommended, see subclause H.1.3 for its computation
ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A
    ; according to IETF RFC 5234(7-Bit ASCII)
DIGIT = %x30-39
    ; according to IETF RFC 5234 (7-Bit ASCII)
<S> = *1 ( "-" )
    ; optional separator
```

An example for a valid eMA ID therefore is `DE8AACA2B3C4D5N` or with dashes
`DE-8AA-CA2B3C4D5-N`.

###### ContractId Semantics
The following rules apply:

 * The ContractId must be interpreted case insensitive.
 * A hyphen ("-") can be used as separator in communication with users to allow better reading, spelling and typing. An example for such
   an illustration is `DE-8AA-CA2B3C4D5-N`. If the hyphenated representation is chosen, the separators must be set at all three places.
 * Each ContractId has a fixed length of at least fourteen and at most fifteen characters excluding the optional hyphens or seventeen
   respectively eighteen characters including the optional separators.
 * While the Provider ID must be assigned by a central issuing authority, each provider with an assigned Provider ID can chose the eMA
   Instance within the above mentioned rules freely.


###### Backward Compatibility
Contract IDs (ContractId) as defined in DIN SPEC 91286 may be used as well by adding
character "C" followed by a zero i.e. ("C0"), at the beginning of the Instance-part and the old
check digit at position 14. A second check digit as referenced in this
document may be calculated over the resulting ID and may be added on position 15.
Example: The DIN-Contract-ID `DE-8AA-123A56-3` must be set as eMA ID `DE-8AA-C0123A563-N`.

###### ID-Structure
One Contract-ID (ContractId) may refer to several Token-IDs (EmtId).
This reflects the situation that one contractual user account can be
authorized by different tokens. The structure can be illustrated as
shown in this figure:

![Figure ID-Structure](media/IDstructure.png "ID-Structure")


### EmtId *class*

The authorisation tokens are defined according to the specification of
the EMT-ID (Token ID). Each token consists of an token instance which
holds the payload and at least the token type. The sub-type is for
further specification of the general token type.

 Field Name      |  Field Type           |  Card.  |  Description
:----------------|:----------------------|:--------|:------------
 instance        |  string(36)           |  1      |  Specification according to the token type.
 representation  |  tokenRepresentation  |  1      |  The token instance may be represented by its hash value (hexadecimal representation of the hash value). This specifies in which representation the token instance is set.
 type            |  tokenType            |  1      |  The type of the supplied instance.
 subType         |  tokenSubType         |  ?      |  The exact type of the supplied instance.



### tokenType *enum*

The type of the supplied instance for basic filtering.

 Value       |  Description
:------------|:-------------
 rfid        |  All kinds of RFID-Cards. Field token Instance holds the hexadecimal representation of the card's UID, Byte order: big endian, no zero-filling.
 remote      |  All means of remote authentication through the backend. Field tokenInstance holds a reference to the remote authorization or session. In case of a OCHPdirect authorization the _directId_.
 15118       |  All authentication means defined by ISO/IEC 15118 except RFID-cards.
 other       |  To accommodate the other energy sources incorporated into the protocol.

 **NOTE:** The _remote_ token type is only beeing used in the CDR of a
 remotely started charging process. Tokens with type _remote_ shall not
 be included in a whitelist.


### tokenSubType *enum*

The exact type of the supplied instance for referencing purpose.

 Value       |  Description
:------------|:-------------
 mifareCls   |  Mifare Classic Card
 mifareDes   |  Mifare Desfire Card
 calypso     |  Calypso Card


### tokenRepresentation *enum*

Specifies the representation of the token to allow hashed token values.

 Value       |  Description
:------------|:-------------
 plain       |  The token instance is represented in plain text. (default)
 sha-160     |  The token instance is represented in its 160bit SHA1 hash in 40 hexadecimal digits.
 sha-256     |  The token instance is represented in its 256bit SHA2 hash in 64 hexadecimal digits.

###### eMT-ID Semantics
The EMT ID can be used to identify any identification token for
e-mobility. The EMT ID is a non-global ID and therefore has no country
code or operator/provider part. This information about the "owning
operator/provider" is delivered by the context of the communication.


### PermissionsType *enum*

RoamingAuthorisationInfo class is extended by the attribute permissions. The PermissionsType (enum) can be set to multiple options. Feature will help EMPs to have better structured and organized customer portfolio.

 Value       	|  Description
:------------	|:-------------
 AC		        |  Alternating current
 DC		        |  Direct current
 CNG		      |  Compressed natural gas
 LNG		      |  Liquified natural gas
 Fuel		      |  Fuel
 H2		        |  Hydrogen
 Ethanol	    |  Ethyl alcohol as fuel
 Other		    |  Other fuel types



### RoamingAuthorisationInfo *class*

Contains information about a roaming authorisation (card/token)

 Field Name     |  Field Type    	|  Card.  |  Description
:---------------|:---------------	|:--------|:------------
 EmtId          |  EmtId         	|  1      |  Electrical Vehicle Contract Identifier

 permissions    |  PermissionsType	|  1      |  Permissions for various energy sources and authorization services
 printedNumber  |  string(150)   	|  ?      |  Might be used for manual authorisation.
 expiryDate     |  DateTimeType  	|  1      |  Tokens may be used until the date of expiry is reached. To be handled by the partners systems. Expired roaming authorisations may be erased locally by each partner's systems.



## Types for the Exchange of Charge Data

These data types are used for the purpose of the exchange of charge data
from an EVSE Operator to an EVSP.


### CdrPeriodType *class*

This class defines one time and billing period in the charge detail
record. Two periods may overlap in time. Each period represents one
billing item of the charging process.
The value *periodCost* is optional and can be calculated from the
other values in the period. The calculation of this total cost of one
charging period is calculated the following way:

periodCost = billingValue * itemPrice [currency]

Therefore the totalCost of a charging process and thus the value
that has to be paid to the operator is calculated by summung up all
period prices:

totalCost = sum( billingValue_i * itemPrice_i ) [currency]

![Figure Example for periods in a CDR](media/CDRperiods.png "Example for periods in a CDR")

 Field Name     |  Field Type         |  Card.  |  Description
:---------------|:--------------------|:--------|:------------
 startDateTime  |  LocalDateTimeType  |  1      |  Starting time of the period. Must be equal or later than startDateTime of the CDRInfo.
 endDateTime    |  LocalDateTimeType  |  1      |  Ending time of the period. Must be equal or earlier than endDateTime of the CDRInfo.
 billingItem    |  BillingItemType    |  1      |  Defines what the EVSP is charged for during this period.
 billingValue   |  float              |  1      |  The value the EVSP is charged for. The unit of this value depends on the billingItem.
 itemPrice      |  float              |  1      |  Price per unit of the billingItem in the given currency.
 periodCost     |  float              |  ?      |  Total cost of the period in the given currency.
 taxrate		|  int				  |  ?      |  Tax rate in percent to be paid for the charging process in the EVSE operator's country.


###### Implementation
Different prices for the individual parts of the pricing model can
be reflected by adding multiple periods to one CDR. There are
various possible combinations of periods to reflect different pricing
models. Some examples:

 * There could be a higher price for the first 30 minutes, followed
   by a lower price. This requires two pricing periods, one for each
   price level.
 * Another operator could charge a start fee per charging session
   plus the energy price per kilowatt hour. This requires two periods,
   one of type *serviceFee* and one of type *energy*, both
   covering the full length of the charging process.
 * Not all roaming relations require rated charge data. If not
   needed, the *itemPrice* may be set to 0 (zero) to explicitly
   reflect a roaming process that will not be charged by the operator.


### CdrStatusType *enum*

Reflects the current status of the CDR. This is reflecting the status
of internal processing in the clearing house. The value cannot be
changed by the partner's systems directly. Implicit changes are made
while uploading (including revised, rejected CDRs), approving or
declining CDRs.  ((new A new CDR before upload to the CHS))

 Value           |  Description
:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------
 accepted        |  An uploaded CDR was accepted by the CHS as plausible.
 declined	       |  The CDR was declined by the owner (EMSP).
 revised	       |  The CDR was revised by the CPO and uploaded again. Only previously accepted or declined CDRs can be revised.
 rejected        |  The declined CDR is rejected by the operator (CPO) and is to be archived by CHS.
 approved        |  The CDR was approved by the owner (EMSP).



### CDRInfo *class*

Contains all information concerning a Charge Data Record

 Field Name       |  Field Type         |  Card.  |  Description
:-----------------|:--------------------|:--------|:------------
 cdrId            |  CdrId		|  1      |  Unique charge data record identifier.

 endDateTime      |  LocalDateTimeType  |  1      |  End date and time of the charge session (log-off with the RFID badge or physical disconnect). Must be set in the local time of the charge point.
 duration         |  string(9)          |  ?      |  Duration of the charge session. Example: "000:00:28"
 chargePointAddress |  AddressType      |  1      |  Contains the address of the charging station.
 chargePointType  |  string(10)         |  1      |  Type of the charge point.

 currency	  |  string(3)		|  1	  |  Alphabetic. The displayed and charged currency. Defined in ISO 4217 - Table A.1, alphabetic list.


### CdrId
The CDR-ID is a unique identifier for charge data records. EvseId is incorporated into the CDR-ID to make it explicit who the CPO is. The length of the string is extended from “36” to “43”.

Case insensitive (normalized to all upper Case, remove optional Separators) (Characters: $[$A-Z$]$, $[$0-9$]$).

**Note:** For compatibility reasons, CDR-IDs from older OCHP implementations will not necessarily include the EvseId/CPO-ID and must only be EVSE-unique.



## Types for the Exchange of Charge Point Information

These data types are used for the purpose of the exchange of charge
point information or POI data from an EVSE Operator to an NSP.


### EvseId

The EVSEID must follow the specification of _ISO/IEC 15118-2 - Annex H "Specification of Identifiers"_.
The EVSEID must match the following structure (the notation corresponds
to the augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as defined in RFC5234):

```ABNF
<EVSEID> = <Country Code> <S> <EVSE Operator ID> <S>
<ID Type> <Power Outlet ID>
<Country Code> = 2 ALPHA
    ; two character country code according to ISO 3166-1 (Alpha-2-Code)
<EVSE Operator ID> = 3 (ALPHA / DIGIT)
    ; three alphanumeric characters, defined and listed by eMI3 group
<ID Type> = "E"
    ; one character "E" indicating that this ID represents an "EVSE"
<Power Outlet ID> = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *30 (ALPHA / DIGIT / <S>)
    ; sequence of alphanumeric characters or separators, start with alphanumeric character
ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A
    ; according to IETF RFC 5234 (7-Bit ASCII)
DIGIT = %x30-39
    ; according to IETF RFC 5234 (7-Bit ASCII)
<S> = *1 ( "*" )
    ; optional separator
```

An example for a valid EVSEID is FR*A23*E45B*78C with FR indicating
France, A23 representing a particular EVSE Operator, E indicating that
it is of type EVSE and 45B*78C representing one of its power outlets.
EVSEID Semantics

The following rules apply:

 * Each EVSEID has a variable length with at least seven characters
   (two characters Country Code, three characters EVSE Operator ID, one
   character ID Type, one character Power Outlet ID) and at most
   thirty-seven characters (two characters Country Code, three characters
   EVSE Operator ID, one character ID Type, thirty-one characters Power
   Outlet ID).
 * While the EVSE Operator ID shall be assigned by a central issuing
   authority, each operator with an assigned EVSE Operator ID can choose
   the Power Outlet ID within the above mentioned rules freely.


###### Backward Compatibility
EVSE-IDs as defined in DIN SPEC 91286 MAY be used by applying the
following mapping:

 * The two digit country code "49" in Germany for geographic areas in
   ITU-T E.164:11/2010 is mapped onto the ISO-3166-1 (Alpha-2-Code).
 * The three digit of spot operator ID is mapped 1:1 into the new
   alphanumeric scheme.
 * All digits are mapped 1:1 into the new alphanumeric scheme.

###### Example
`+49*823*1234*5678` is interpreted as `DE*823*E1234*5678`


### evseImageUrlType *class*

This class references images related to a EVSE in terms of a file name
or uri. According to the roaming connection between one EVSE Operator
and one or more Navigation Service Providers the hosting or file
exchange of image payload data has to be defined. The exchange of this
content data is out of scope of OCHP. However, the recommended setup is
a publicly available web server hosted and updated by the EVSE Operator.
Per charge point an unlimited number of images of each type is allowed.
Recommended are at least two images where one is a network or provider
logo and the second is a station photo. If two images of the same type
are defined they should be displayed additionally, not optionally.

###### Photo Dimensions
The recommended dimensions for all photos are minimum 800 pixels wide
and 600 pixels height. Thumbnail representations for photos should
always have the same orientation than the original with a size of 200
to 200 pixels.

###### Logo Dimensions
The recommended dimensions for logos are exactly 512 pixels wide and
512 pixels height. Thumbnail representations for logos should be
exactly 128 pixels in with and height. If not squared, thumbnails
should have the same orientation than the original.

 Field Name  |  Field Type   |  Card.  |  Description
:------------|:--------------|:--------|:------------
 uri         |  string(255)  |  1      |  uri from where the image data can be fetched. Must begin with a protocol of the list: http, https, file, ftp. Regex: <code>(http&#124;https&#124;ftp&#124;file):\/\/.+</code>
 thumbUri    |  string(255)  |  ?      |  uri from where a thumbnail of the image can be fetched. Must begin with a protocol of the list: http, https, file, ftp
 class       |  ImageClass   |  1      |  Image class for usage categorization
 type        |  string(4)    |  1      |  Image type like: gif, jpeg, png, svg
 width       |  int(5)       |  ?      |  Width of the full scale image
 height      |  int(5)       |  ?      |  Height of the full scale image


### ImageClass *enum*

The class of a EVSE image to obtain the correct usage in an user presentation. Has to be set accordingly to the image content in order to guaranty the right usage.

 Value         |  Description

## Types for Tariff Data Exchange

These types are used to exchange tariff information between an operator and one or more providers.

### TariffId
The tariffId follows a similar syntax to that of contract- and EVSE-IDs. The Operator-ID is followed by a 'T' that signifies a tariff and a unique instance of up to 30 characters. The max. length allowed for TariffId is string(36).

###### Regular Expression

```regex
[A-Z]{2}\*[A-Za-z0-9]{3}\*[Tt][A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\*]{0,29}
[A-Z]{2}[A-Za-z0-9]{3}[Tt][A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\*]{0,29}
```


### IndividualTariffType *class*

 Field Name          |  Field Type               |  Card.  |  Description
:--------------------|:--------------------------|:--------|:------------
 currency            | string (3)                | 1       | Currency of this tariff, ISO 4217 Code
 tariffElement       | TariffElementType 	 | +       | List of tariff elements.
 recipient           | string (5) 	   	 | *       | Provider-IDs of the intended recipients for this tariff. If no recipient is provided, this individual tariff is considered the default tariff.


**Note:** Tariffs are referenced on connector level by their tariff-ID only. Every EVSE Operator is advised to define one default individual tariff for each tariffId as a fallback in addition to the individual tariffs defined for certain recipients. A provider will only receive tariffs that they are recipient for.


### TariffElementType *class*

 Field Name          |  Field Type               |  Card.  |  Description
:--------------------|:--------------------------|:--------|:------------
 priceComponent      | PriceComponentType        | 1       | Price component defining this TariffElement.
 tariffRestriction   | TariffRestrictionType     | 1       | List of tariff restrictions applicable for this TariffElement / PriceComponent.


### PriceComponentType *class*

 Field Name          |  Field Type               |  Card.  |  Description
:--------------------|:--------------------------|:--------|:------------
 billingItem	     | BillingItemType 		 | 1       | Type of tariff dimension
 itemPrice	     | float	                 | 1       | price per unit for this tariff dimension (unit according to dimension, see BillingItemType description)
 stepSize	     | float                     | 1       | Minimum amount to be billed. This unit will be billed in this stepSize blocks. For example: if billingItem is usagetime and  stepSize is 0.1, then time will be billed in blocks of 6 minutes, so if 8 minutes is used, 12 minutes (2 blocks of stepSize) will be billed. In case of one-time payments, this is to be set to 1.0.


### TariffRestrictionType *class*

 Field Name          |  Field Type               |  Card.  |  Description
:--------------------|:--------------------------|:--------|:------------
 regularHours	     | RegularHoursType		 | *	   | Regular hours that this tariff element should be valid for (maximum of 14 entries). If always valid (24/7), don't set (as this is a tariff restriction).
 startDate           | DateType			 | ?       | Start date, for example: 2015-12-24, valid from this day (midnight, i.e. including this day)
 endDate             | DateType 		 | ?       | End date, for example: 2015-12-27, valid until this day (midnight, i.e. excluding this day)

 maxPower            | float			   | ?       | Maximum power in kW, for example 20.0, valid up to this charging speed
 minDuration         | int           | ?       | Minimum duration in seconds, valid for a duration from x seconds
 maxDuration         | int           | ?       | Maximum duration in seconds, valid for a duration up to x seconds


### TariffInfo *class*

 A Tariff Object consists of a list of one or more individual tariffs for individual recipients. One default individual tariff should always be defined without a specific recipient.
 Each individual tariff consists of tariff elements. These elements can be used to create complex Tariff structures.

 Changes to a tariff can always only be made to the entire tariff object. That way it is ensured that there cannot be multiple conflicting tariffs referenced at the same connector.  

  Field Name          |  Field Type               |  Card.  |  Description
 :--------------------|:--------------------------|:--------|:------------
  tariffId            | TariffId	            	  | 1       | Uniquely identifies the tariff.
  individualTariff    | IndividualTariffType	    | +	      | Contains multiple individual tariffs dependant on intended recipient.



### Examples

#### Simple Tariff example
2 euro per hour default tariff

```XML
<TariffInfoArray>
	<tariffId>YYABCT01</tariffId>
	<individualTariff>
		<tariffElement>
			<priceComponent>
				<billingItem>
					<BillingItemType>usagetime</BillingItemType>
				</billingItem>
				<itemPrice>2.0</itemPrice>
				<stepSize>0.0</stepSize>
			</priceComponent>
			<tariffRestriction/>
		</tariffElement>
		<currency>EUR</currency>
	</individualTariff>
</TariffInfoArray>
```

#### Complex Tariff example
- 2.50 euro start tariff
- 1.00 euro per hour charging tariff for less than 11kW (paid per 15 minutes)
- 2.00 euro per hour charging tariff for more than 11kW on weekdays (paid per 12 minutes)
- 1.25 euro per hour charging tariff for more than 11kW during the weekend (paid per 12 minutes)

Parking costs:
- Weekdays: between 09:00 and 18:00 : 5 euro (paid per 6 minutes)
- Saturday: between 10:00 and 17:00 : 6 euro (paid per 6 minutes)

all of the above as the default tariff

with additional 2 euro per hour tariff for YYCBA-provider (paid exactly as consumed)

## Types for the Live Status Interface

These data types are used for the purpose of the exchange of live
status information in addition to the charge point information or
POI data from an EVSE Operator to an NSP.


### ParkingId
The parking-ID follows a similar syntax to that of contract- and EVSE-IDs. The Parking Spot Operator ID (PSO-ID) is followed by a 'P' that signifies a parking spot and a unique instance of up to 30 characters. The max. length allowed for ParkingId is string(36).

###### Regular Expression

```regex
[A-Z]{2}\*[A-Za-z0-9]{3}\*[Pp][A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\*]{0,29}
[A-Z]{2}[A-Za-z0-9]{3}[Pp][A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\*]{0,29}
```


### EvseStatusType *class*

Specifies the major and minor status of a EVSE.

 Field Name  |  Field Type    |  Card.  |  Description
:------------|:---------------|:--------|:------------
 evseId      |  EvseId        |  1      |  The EVSE the status is set for.
 major~      |  MajorType     |  1      |  The major status value for the EVSE.
 minor~      |  MinorType     |  ?      |  The minor status value for the EVSE.
 ttl~        |  DateTimeType  |  ?      |  The time to live is set as the deadline until which the status value is to be considered valid. Should be set to the expected status change.


### MajorType *enum*

The major status type reflects the overall status of the EVSE.

 Value          |  Description
:---------------|:-------------
 available      |  the EVSE is able to start a new charging process
 not-available  |  at the moment no new charging process may be started
 unknown        |  the current status of the EVSE is not known


### MinorType *enum*

The optional minor status type reflects the detailed status of
the EVSE in addition to the major status.
For each minor status value a proposed ttl value is given.
However, the ttl should only be set to a value other than
default if the expected status change is known or can be
predicted.

 Value       |  Description
:------------|:-------------
 available   |  the EVSE is able to start a new charging process
 reserved    |  the EVSE is able to start a new charging process for limited duration as a future reservation is present. ttl to be set on the start of the reservation when in future or to the end of the reservation else
 charging    |  the EVSE is in use. ttl to be set on the expected end of the charging process
 blocked     |  the EVSE not accessible because of a physical barrier, i.e. a car
 outoforder  |  the EVSE is currently out of order. ttl to be set to the expected re-enabling


### ParkingStatusType *class*

Specifies the live status of a parking spot.

 Field Name  |  Field Type    |  Card.  |  Description
:------------|:---------------|:--------|:------------
 parkingId   |  ParkingId     |  1      |  The parking spot the status is set for.
 status~     |  MajorType     |  1      |  The status value of the parking spot.
 ttl~        |  DateTimeType  |  ?      |  The time to live is set as the deadline until which the status value is to be considered valid. Should be set to the expected status change.


# Binding to Transport Protocol

This section describes how the CHS PDUs can be conveyed over SOAP.
The rationale behind using SOAP as a transport is that SOAP already
provides the infrastructure of sending messages. SOAP has a good support
in the industry, which results in tools that improve the ease of
implementing the protocol.
For this protocol the SOAP Version 1.1 MUST be used.



## User Identification

Authentication must be done via WS-Security Username Token within the
SOAP Header. The Password is specified as "passwordText".
Example:

```XML
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:ns="urn://stationoperator/charging/ws/2012/11/" xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
<soapenv:Header>
<wsse:Security soapenv:mustUnderstand="1" xmlns:wsse="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd">
<wsse:UsernameToken wsu:Id="UsernameToken-1" xmlns:wsu="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd">
<wsse:Username>theUsername</wsse:Username>
<wsse:Password Type="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0#PasswordText">thePassword</wsse:Password>
</wsse:UsernameToken>
</wsse:Security>
</soapenv:Header>
<soapenv:Body>...
```

## ID Validation and Transformation Tools



### Regular expression for EVSE-ID validation

This will match on a valid EVSE-ID. The positive look ahead at the very
end has to be changed depending on the usage or implementation.

###### Regular Expression

```regex
[A-Z]\{2\}(\*?)[A-Z0-9]\{3\}(?:\2)[E][A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\*]\{0,30\}(?=\s)
```



### Regular expression for ContractId validation

This will match on a valid Contract-ID. The positive look ahead at the very end has to be changed depending on the usage or implementation. The
check digit has to be validated in a separate step.

###### Regular Expression

```regex
[A-Z]{2}-[A-Za-z0-9]{3}-[Cc][A-Za-z0-9]{8}-[A-Za-z0-9]
[A-Z]{2}-[A-Za-z0-9]{3}-[Cc][A-Za-z0-9]{8}
[A-Z]{2}[A-Za-z0-9]{3}[Cc][A-Za-z0-9]{8}[A-Za-z0-9]
[A-Z]{2}[A-Za-z0-9]{3}[Cc][A-Za-z0-9]{8}
```



### Regular expression for ContractId normalization

This will remove the optional separators from a valid ContractId.

###### Regular Expression

```regex
([A-Za-z]\{2\})(-?)([A-Za-z0-9]\{3\})(?:\2)[Cc]([A-Za-z0-9]\{9\})(?:(?\2)([A-Za-z0-9]))?(?=\s)
```



## List of examples for valid ContractIds

These are different possibilities for syntactically correct ContractIds.

## EVSE Infrastructure Model

The interface described in this protocol is defined on EVSE level.
However, there are more data structure layers to be considered in the
connected systems. To allow for correct mapping to other data
structures the following reference is provided.
Visualisations of different charging stations are given in the section
below.


### Data Model Structure

The reference structure for charge point data is shown in the figure
below. This hierarchical model maps the entities connector, charge
point (or EVSE), charging station and EVSE Operator in four levels. The
physical charge pole as a common casing for one multiple charge points
is explicitly excluded from the model. The physical combination of
multiple charge points in one pole is not affecting the logical
relation of those. However, the attributes of the EVSE level may
indicate to its existence when two EVSEs share a common user interface.

![Figure EVSE Data Model Structure](media/EVSEstructure.png "EVSE Data Model Structure")

The architecture of the data model is based on the logical relations of
the entities with a focus on the use cases for the EV user. The
electrical connection of charge points, for example, is not influencing
the data structure.
Each entity may have certain attributes attached. For the mapping to
the OCHP data types and messages, the common attributes of parent
entities are attached to the EVSE level. This results in repetitive
data but allows maximum in flexibility.
Most noteworthy consequences from this data structure are the fact,
that all EVSEs in one station should be managed by the same operator
and that all charge points of one station should physically be situated
in next to each other. It is also necessary that all Navigation Service
Provider backends and data models are able to assign multiple
connectors to one charge point.
Depending on the use case, different inheritance and aggregation of
attributes is possible or may be necessary. For example requires the
search for a available charging station to find one single available
EVSE, what is relatively simple with the flat OCHP data model. If in
another use case the search for a station with at least two available
EVSEs is required, a aggregation of the data to the station level might
be useful.
Please note that other layers might exist or be added in the future.


### Examples

In order to visualize the different possible situations of supply
equipment, this section contains some examples. Of course not all
possible cases can be reflected. As OCHP is not modelling the full data
structure but only the EVSE level, the aggregation to the higher and
lower levels has to be performed in the connected systems. This allows
high flexibility in the different data models.
The used symbols in the examples are:

 * **User Interface** is used by the EV User to interact with the
   charging station in terms of authorisation, authentication, payment
   or charging process controlling purpose. Common examples for a user
   interface is a RFID card reader and a display. Also a keypad and
   direct payment methods are possible additions.
 * **Physical Charge Pole** is the case mounted on the location. In the
   scope of this protocol there is no distinction between wall-mounted
   and stand-alone charge poles. Even other concepts are possible but
   do not interfere the data model.
 * **EVSE** is one charge point that can independently be used for EV
   charging. It may host one or multiple connectors which can be used
   exclusively.
 * **Connector** is the physical power outlet the electric vehicle is
   connected to. May also be inductive.
 * **Parking Spot** offers space for exactly one car. Depending on the
   location and physical constraints like the cable, it is possible to
   assign one parking spot to multiple charge points.
 * **Reserved Parking Spot** is for a dedicated user group only. Common
   examples are company fleet cars or car sharing cars.
 * **Pool Grouping Boundaries** illustrate the virtual grouping of
   multiple EVSEs to one pool.


##### Example One
is showing one charging station (at one postal address) which itself
consists of one physical charge pole. This pole holds two EVSEs or
charge points for simultaneous use. Each of those EVSEs offers two
different connectors of different type. Those can be used exclusively
only. The two EVSEs can be accessed through a mutual user interface.
For each EVSE one single parking spot is reserved.
This example represents the most common case for public charging
stations. The charging station consists of one single charge pole only.
Therefore there is a risk to confuse the terms pole and station. The
following examples will make the difference clear.

![Figure Example 1](media/EVSEstructureExamples--1.png "Example 1")


##### Example Two
is showing two charging stations (at two different postal addresses) of
which each consists of one physical charge pole. Each of those poles
holds two EVSEs or charge points for simultaneous use. Each of those
EVSEs offers two different connectors of different type. Those can be
used exclusively only. The two EVSEs can be accessed through a mutual
user interface. For each EVSE one single parking spot is reserved.
In fact, the two charging stations in this example are just exactly two
times example one. Each of the stations is placed at a individual
location not related to each other.

##### Example Three
is showing one charging station (at one postal address) which consists
of two physical charge poles. Each of those poles holds two EVSEs or
charge points for simultaneous use. Each of those EVSEs offers two
different connectors of different type. Those can be used exclusively
only. The two EVSEs can be accessed through a mutual user interface.
For each EVSE one single parking spot is reserved. The charging station
can be utilized by four cars simultaneously as it has four EVSEs and
hence has four parking spots in total.
In contrast to example two, both charge poles are located close to each
other at the same postal address. Therefore they are communicated as
one single charging station to the user. Other circumstances like a
common electrical connection or a mutual controlling and communication
unit is not decisive for this combination.

##### Example Four
is showing one charging station (at one address) which consists of four
physical charge poles. Each of those poles holds one EVSE or charge
point for simultaneous use. Each of those EVSEs offers two different
connectors of different type. Those can be used exclusively only. All
four EVSEs of the four charge poles can be accessed through a mutual
user interface, installed in a separate pole at the charging station.
For each EVSE one single parking spot is reserved. The charging station
can be utilized by four cars simultaneously as it has four EVSEs and
hence has four parking spots in total.
This example is similar to the previous example three. This one
charging station may be communicated to the user under one single name.
In the attributes for the station the user will find the number of
charge points which is the same as in example three.

## Charge Point Information Filtering

The Navigation Service Provider displays charging point information to
the EV User. Usually not all charge points are relevant for every user.
The most common case is to display only compatible stations to the car
that have at least one available charge point. To gain a mutual
understanding of the different filtering steps between the EVSE
Operator and the NSP, the following description is provided.
Every charge point is represented by a static data set
(*ChargePointInfo*) and additional dynamic data (*EvseStatusType*). The
filtering for compatible charge points close to the current location of
the EV user is performed on the static data which may be stored locally
on the navigation device. In a second step the result may be filtered
for current availability.

##### Preface
Based on the characteristics of the user's car and other preferences as
well as the current location, a set of possible charge points can be
determined. Based on such a set the further filtering for currently
available charge points is described in the figure below.
The six steps are:

 * **A** All charge points that are not operative for various
   reasons are to be removed from the set. (status not equal
   *Operative*)
 * **B** Charge points that have no regular operating hours at the
   current moment are to be removed from the set. (*now* not in
   operatingTimes.regularHours)
 * **C** Charge points that have a exceptional closing at the
   current moment are to be removed from the set. (*now* in
   operatingTimes.exceptionalClosings)
 * **D** Those charge points from step *B* that have exceptional
   openings have to be re-added to the set. (*now* in
   operatingTimes.exceptionalOpenings)
 * **E** All other charge points that remain in the set and the
   charge points from step *D* are considered operative and
   accessible at the current moment and may be tested for
   availability.
 * **F** Charge points with a live status value other than
   *Available* are to be removed. (liveStatus not eqal *Available*)

The remaining charge points in the data set are operative and available
at the current moment and can be displayed to the EV User.
