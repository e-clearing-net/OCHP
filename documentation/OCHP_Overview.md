# Introduction
The Open Clearing House Protocol enables boundless electric vehicle charging across charging station networks. Using OCHP, service providers for EV charging can connect to infrastructure providers in order to provide access to their network.

Open Clearing House Protocol (OCHP) has the purpose to connect market actors in the field of electric mobility charging infrastructure. This protocol enables parties to communicate between their own back-end system (like a CMS) and a clearing house system, in a simple way.

OCHP is an open source protocol. It offers a uniform, SOAP based, interface solution. Everyone is free to implement and to actively participate in the development of the protocol, which is rapidly becoming the free international standard in the electric vehicle market.


# USPs

# Stakeholders e-mobility
 * The [EMP](/documentation/EMP_documentation.md "EMP") (Electric Mobility Provider) - granting access to 
   charging stations and thus offering services to the contracted EV 
   user. The service offer is supported by the market roles CPO and NSP.
 * The [CPO](/documentation/CPO_documentation.md "CPO") (Charge Point Operator) - 
   operating charging stations.
 * The [NSP](/documentation/NSP_documentation.md "NSP") (Navigation Service Provider) - offering relevant 
   navigation services to the EV user.
 * The [PSO](/documentation/PSO_documentation.md "PSO") - owning and/or operating the parking
   spots that allow access to the charging infrastructure owned/operated by the EVSE Operator.
 * The [DSO](/documentation/DSO_documentation.md "DSO") - consume POI Data, much like the Navigation Service Provider (NSP).
   This service will allow the DSO to retrieve Data on installed capacity of chargers and current energy flow in a standardized format.
